# Gl Matcher Home Assignment

Please clone this directory and read the manual in order to understand how to run the application.
for your convenience, I've attached to the email a postman file for the testing of the product locally.

## Run App Locally

1. Please create a local virtual environment using the commend `python3 -m venv env`.
2. Activate the local virtual environment by running `source env/bin/activate`.
3. In the project, I've included a `requirements.txt`. You will have to use it to install all of dependencies of the project. Use the commend `pip install -r ./path_to/requirements.txt`.
4. Run the commend `python3 manage.py runserver` in order to start the server.
5. you can now test the application locally.
